    <h1>Company History</h1>
    <p>Monsters Inc. was founded in 1933 by a visionary monster named James P. Sullivan, affectionately known as "Sully." The company began as a humble startup in Monstropolis, initially specializing in the business of scaring children to generate scream energy. Sully's dedication to perfection and his partnership with his best friend and fellow scarer, Mike Wazowski, quickly propelled the company to the forefront of the scream industry.</p>
    <p>Over the years, Monsters Inc. became renowned for its unparalleled expertise in scaring and scream collection. They developed innovative scare technologies, trained top-notch scarers, and maintained a commitment to excellence that set them apart from the competition. For decades, their mission was to keep Monstropolis powered by screams, delivering reliable energy to every home and business.</p>
    <p>However, in 2001, a pivotal moment in the company's history occurred. Sully and Mike discovered the power of laughter as a more sustainable and positive energy source. With a bold decision, they transformed Monsters Inc. from a scream factory into a laugh factory, forever changing the course of their company and Monstropolis.</p>
    <p>The transition was challenging, but Monsters Inc. successfully reinvented itself as a leader in laugh collection and energy production. Today, Monsters Inc. stands as a beacon of laughter, innovation, and community engagement in Monstropolis, bringing joy and positivity to every corner of the city.</p>
